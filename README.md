In our research exploring the differences in academic performance between urban and rural students, the impact of family background on academic outcomes, and the relationship between motivations for school choice and student attendance and grades. Two datasets about math and portuguese includes whether a student is from an urban or rural area, parental occupations and education levels, family structure (such as whether parents are divorced), reasons for choosing a school, and weekly study time among students.

We anticipate challenging several widespread societal stereotypes, such as "urban students perform better academically than rural students," "children from families where parents have higher educational levels achieve better academically," and "students from stable family structures have higher attendance rates." These stereotypes can have profound implications on educational policies and practices at home.

To investigate whether these stereotypes are supported by evidence, we will employ the following statistical methods and visualizations:

    Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Initial exploration of the data will be conducted through calculating statistics like means, medians, and standard deviations to reveal the basic characteristics of different groups.
    Box Plots: We will use box plots to show the distribution of test scores and absenteeism across different professions, educational backgrounds, and family structures to see if significant differences exist.
    Correlation Analysis: Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients will be calculated to test the strength and direction of relationships between family background factors and student academic performance.
    Multiple Regression Analysis: We will build regression models to assess the impact of individual factors (such as parental education level) on academic performance, controlling for other variables.
    Bar Charts and Scatter Plots: Bar charts will be used to compare the average scores of different student groups, and scatter plots will illustrate the relationship between study time and academic performance.

Through these methods, we aim not only to validate the truth behind these stereotypes but also to provide more precise data support for educational policymakers, helping them better understand the various factors affecting student performance. Additionally, this study may reveal unexpected patterns, offering new perspectives for educational practices and research.
